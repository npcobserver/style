  - In the case of a Party entity, don't refer to the Party in its name; instead, use its shortened, colloquial name and add <kbd>☭</kbd> (set off by a space) before it, as done [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/national-security-law/), [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/national-defense-education-law/), or [here](https://npcobserver.com/constitution/).

  - Separate different plans by <kbd>;</kbd>.
  - Use the information given in the "Bill Pages_五年立法规划统计.docx" file on Dropbox.
- Annual plans
  - Separate different plans by <kbd>,</kbd>. Add "(backup)" after a year (set off by a space) if the bill was a 预备审议项目.

##### Details
- List entries reverse chronologically, with the newest at the top.
- **Date**
  - Abbreviate the months.
  - Use en-dashes (<kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> in macOS) to separate two dates. Adding a space before and after the en-dash is **optional**; the site will automatically add either a "six-per-em space" (`U+2006`; <span style="background-color: #0F52BD">&#x2006;</span>) or "thin space" (`U+2009`; <span style="background-color: #0F52BD">&#x2009;</span>) before and after an en-dash or replace any space with it.
  - Do NOT repeat the month or year if it's the same on both sides of the en-dash.
- **Text**
  - If a webpage or file includes both a text and a comparison chart, apply its link to the relevant language name and the 🆚 emoji. Otherwise, separate them with <kbd>·</kbd> (with a space before and after it).
  - "(<span class="smcp">Current Text</span> 🔝)"
    - Enter this code in "Edit in HTML" mode: <kbd>(&lt;span class="small-caps"&gt;Current Text&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span class="emoji-jump-link"&gt;🔝&lt;/span&gt;)</kbd>. If the code is entered correctly, clicking the 🔝 emoji will make the page scroll up to the <span class="smcp">Current Text</span> at the top of page (or to the nearest <span class="smcp">Current Text</span> above, as seen [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/hong-kong-basic-law/)).
    - Use **only** in the case of a new law or a revision, not an amendment. Add it **even when** the text of the new law or revised law is not yet available.
- **NPCSC Consultation Shortcode**
  - Add a space between the "text" parenthentical and the shortcode.
  - Make sure the URL entered is NOT active (i.e., can't be clicked).
  - If entered correctly, the shortcode will generate the 💬 emoji at the end of the line and begin a new indented bullet with information like <kbd><a href="https://npcobserver.com/2025/06/china-npc-consultation-emergency-aviation-community-governance-social-assistance-healthcare-food-safety-law/">Public Consultation</a>: June 27 – July 26, 2025</kbd>. While the consultation is ongoing, the shortcode will also add the 🔔 emoji and a <span style="background-color:#F9EBBE">yellow background</span>.
- **Other Public Consultations**
  - In general, use "State Council" when an administrative agency solicited public comment, even a nominal one.
  - Do NOT specify the State Council agency that solicited public comment.
  - Link the ✍️ emoji to the official notice.
- **Explanatory Parentheticals**
  - In the case of 法律修改, number multiple State Council consultations by round **only if** (1) the method of modification was the same; and (2) in the case of an amendment, the changes were not substantially different (may rely on 草案说明, if available). Otherwise, add an explanatory parenthetical immediately after "public consultation"—and before the <kbd>—</kbd> or <kbd>:</kbd>—to distinguish the drafts, as done [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/tax-collection-administration-law/) and [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/food-safety-law/).
  - In the case of a codification bill, add similar explanatory parentheticals if necessary, as done [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/civil-code/) and [here](https://npcobserver.com/legislation/ecological-and-environmental-code/).

- Include "Report on Deliberation Opinions" **only when** it is publicly available.
- Do NOT include the number of a presidential order or NPC public announcement.

- List a "Press Conference" only if the relevant bill is at least one of the designated topics of the press conference.
- Abbreviate the month.
- If both "Official Q&A" and "Press Conference" are listed, order them chronologically; if both have the same date, list the "Official Q&A" first.
